In my memory, the curriculums were not very difficult but really boring. In those years, lots of people who study mathematics were led to an abstract way, where the subject was characterized as philosophy, instead of science languate. Read some modern text books wrote by the excellent  scholars, I rebuilt my understanding to mathematics, here are:\nCalculus, James Stewart\nLinear algebra with applications, Steven J.Leon\nProbability and statistics, Morris H.

There are many so called value investents are speculation natually. But economics should be science. It shares many ideas and approaches with management, such that, risks and management, optimization, time series analysis, games, and so on.","computer#Computer":"I wrote my first BASIC program at 14, I have been computer teacher, IT engineer, programmer. I always keep exciting to compute and following technologies, even though I moved my career focus to management for years and missed many big things like Web 2.0, mobile and Bitcoin. Fortulately, in algorithm and language area, there are so many \"old faces\" that I met many years ago, so that I still can catch the edges of machine learning and programming.
